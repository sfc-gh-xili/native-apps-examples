-- This is the setup script that runs while installing a Snowflake Native App in a consumer account.
-- For more information on how to create setup file, visit https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/creating-setup-script

-- A general guideline to building this script looks like:
-- 1. Create application roles
CREATE APPLICATION ROLE IF NOT EXISTS app_public;

-- 2. Create a versioned schema to hold those UDFs/Stored Procedures
CREATE OR ALTER VERSIONED SCHEMA core;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA core TO APPLICATION ROLE app_public;
-- 3. Create a view referencing the shared view in the package shared-content.sql.
CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS core.shared_view
AS SELECT * FROM package_shared.PROVIDER_SPOTIFY_VIEW;

-- 4. Grant appropriate privileges over the view to your application roles. 
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW core.shared_view TO APPLICATION ROLE app_public;

-- 3. Create a streamlit object using the code you wrote in you wrote in src/module-ui, as shown below. 
-- The `from` value is derived from the stage path described in snowflake.yml
CREATE STREAMLIT core.ui
     FROM '/streamlit/'
     MAIN_FILE = 'ui.py';

-- 4. Grant appropriate privileges over these objects to your application roles. 
GRANT USAGE ON STREAMLIT core.ui TO APPLICATION ROLE app_public;

-- A detailed explanation can be found at https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/adding-streamlit
